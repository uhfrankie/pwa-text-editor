# (PWA): Text Editor

## User Story
AS A developer
I WANT to better understand how a PWA is setup
SO THAT I can explain the purpose in a technical setting

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a completed text editor web application
WHEN I showcase the application in the video
THEN I should be able to explain all aspects of a PWA
WHEN I show the webpack plugins
THEN I explain how I have a generated HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file
WHEN I open the text editor
THEN I show that IndexedDB has immediately created a database storage
WHEN I enter content and subsequently click off of the DOM window
THEN I explain how the content in the text editor has been saved with IndexedDB
WHEN I reopen the text editor after closing it
THEN I explain how the content in the text editor has been retrieved from our IndexedDB
WHEN I load my web application
THEN I should have, and can explain, the registered service worker using workbox
```
